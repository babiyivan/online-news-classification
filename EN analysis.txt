# POS Tagging and Stopword Issues

## Issues Identified

### POS Tagging
- **Misclassification of Proper Nouns**: Proper nouns were frequently misclassified due to lowercasing. For example:
  - "Unity Foods" was tagged as NOUN instead of PROPN.
  - "Edvard Munchâ€™s" was tagged as NOUN instead of PROPN.
  - "residents" are tagged as PROPN instead of NOUN.
  - "Jane" is tagged as NOUN instead of PROPN.
  - "Fondas" is tagged as VERB instead of PROPN.


### Stopwords
- Some stopwords (that, do, we, d, s) were inadvertently left in the text.

## Improvements Implemented

### Enhanced Tokenization
- Integrated spaCy's tokenizer to address complex tokenization cases more effectively. This change also resolved the issue of leftover stopwords.

Overall, while some errors still persist, there has been a significant reduction in their occurrence. These improvements lead to better analysis and more meaningful insights from the text data.
